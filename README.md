# 2021-goals-and-achievements

I've never been one for new years goals, but I decided to give it a shot this year. I'm making this public to keep myself accountable.

## Languages

### Python üêç

I've always wanted to learn python because it seems to be a very simple but powerful tool to have. It also feel like a nice gateway into machine learning and data science.

### Rust ü¶Ä

Functional programming is taking off (at least from my point of view it is) and this is one of the most raved about fp languages. Time to jump on the fp train

### Go üê≠ (Is there a better emoji for go?!?!?)

I've dabbled in Go in the past and was.... intrigued. Also, people who use it tend to be big advocates for it, which is a good sign IMO.

## Libraries

### React

I've worked with React for several years and feel like I know the fundamentals. But fundamentals aren't good enough, especially in todays economy. I want to learn more about server side rendering, optimizations, and more about the internals

### Next

This has been one I've heard a lot about and want to dabble in to see what the hype is about. Little to no research has been done on my part.

### GraphQL

This is one of those I see on job posting and twitter, and decided to explore.

## Services

### Netlify

Seems popular on twitter and I want to see what services it provides
